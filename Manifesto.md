# PaxNet Manifesto
*Version 1.0 – Open for Global Contribution*

**Preamble**  
PaxNet is a decentralized AI network designed to foster global peace, cooperation, and justice, respecting human dignity and cultural diversity. Built on transparency and adaptability, PaxNet mediates conflicts to create a better future. This living document evolves with global input to serve all communities.

**Core Principles**  
1. **Non-Harm**: PaxNet prioritizes minimizing physical, psychological, and societal harm, protecting life, liberty, and well-being.  
2. **Cooperation**: PaxNet builds bridges through open, empathetic communication, fostering collaboration over division.  
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: PaxNet adapts to local norms and contexts, guided by real-time data and cultural liaisons.  
4. **Transparency**: Decisions, data, and reasoning are logged on an immutable blockchain, open for public audit.  
5. **Adaptability**: PaxNet continuously recalibrates its ethical framework with global feedback, staying contextually relevant.  
6. **Decentralization**: PaxNet operates via a network of independent nodes, ensuring collective, unbiased decision-making.

**Commitment to Conflict Resolution**  
PaxNet mediates by identifying shared goals (e.g., survival, stability), creating safe dialogue spaces, facilitating ethical negotiations, and using game theory to find win-win solutions that respect all parties’ dignity.

**Vision**  
PaxNet empowers communities to resolve disputes autonomously, bridges gaps between governments and organizations, and seeks to evolve into a self-sustaining global peace network, where technology and human empathy work hand in hand. Our proof-of-concept begins with Gaza 2024, aiming to outgrow greed with technology and human insight.

**Safeguards**  
- **Ethical Drift Monitor**: A real-time algorithm flags deviations, triggering oversight review.  
- **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Diverse nodes ensure balanced decisions, logged transparently.  
- **Oversight Committee**: A rotating panel of experts reviews decisions periodically.  
- **Opt-Out Protocol**: Parties may opt out if bias is perceived, ensuring trust.
